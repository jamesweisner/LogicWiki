Goal:
	Provide a reliable resource for deciding the validity of complex arguments.

Means:
	deconstruction
		logical framework
		recursion
		tagging
	reputation
		weighted vote
		democracy
		gamification
		consistency as predictor of good



when a new argument is created, it starts as a draft
the author can make changes, and ask for advice/help from others
once the author is satisfied, the argument is "published"
published arguments can be voted on, and cannot be changed.
users can "support" or "reject" arguments they author.
the supporter of an argument may change their mind and reject it and vica versa.

how are the validity of propositions evaluated?
		atomic propositions are voted on
		propositions that are the premise of one argument
				may be the conclusions of another argument
				in which case their validity takes that argument into account

how do i evaluate the validity of argument 1?
		check that conclusion follows from premise using formal logic
		evaluate the validity of premises
			premise 1 is the conclusion of argument 2
				it is valid if argument 2 is valid
				examine argument 2 for its currently calculated validity (not recursive)
				apply that to premise 1
			check validity of premise 2
				voting history only since no arguments have been made

Argument 1:
if A then B -> wikipedia
if B then C -> wikipedia
-----------
if A then C -> valid

Argument 2:
if A then C -> Argument 1
if C then B -> wikipedia
-----------
if A then B -> circular FALLACY

Argument 3:
if A then C -> wikipedia
if C then B -> wikipedia
-----------
if A then B -> valid, but still in tension with argument 1
