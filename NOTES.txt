Goal
----

To provide a reliable resource for deciding the validity of complex arguments.

Publishing
----------

When a new argument is created, it starts as a draft.
The author can make changes and ask for advice/help from other users.
The author has the power to remove any comments by other users to their argument.
Once the author is satisfied, the argument is published. Only published arguments can be endorsed.
Unpublishing in order to change an argument remove all votes.
An argument cannot be changed after it has received 100 votes.

Endorsement
-----------

Any users besides the author can endorse:

	* That the structure of an argument is valid or invalid
	* That an individual premise is sound or unsound

If a user endorses the validity and soundness of all premises they endorse the conclusion as true.
If an endorsed conclusion is used as a premise for another argument, it's automatically endorsed it as sound.
Automatic endorsement is made by strings comparison of the conclusion with premises of other arguments.
This automatic endorsement cannot be changed by the user. Instead, the user has to re-evaluare the supporting argument.
Users can change validity/soundness endorsements at any time.

Social
------

Users can add friends and @ other users in comments.
Users can opt in to notices:
	- Friend published an argument
	- Someone @ you in a comment
	- Someone left a comment on your argument
